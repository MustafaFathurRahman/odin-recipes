# Odin Recipes
I am currently working on a project named odin-recipes. It is a project that is provided by the odin curriculum to practice my HTML knowledge. In this project i will have to make a simple recipe website with HTML basic that i have learned and it will be adjust later if i decided so. 
note: I do not own any recipes description, ingredients, and steps explanation.
